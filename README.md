# Applcations in Computer Vision

### Introduction
A picture can be stored in computers as a set of vertices. The vertices can then be plotted and connected with lines to produce the picture. These pictures can be transformed by changing the positions of the vertices and redrawing the image. For linear transformations, we can use matrix multiplication with special transformation matrices.

### Summary
This notebook is a demonstration of linear transformations in the context of computer graphics and animation.
Transformations demonstrated include dialations and contractions, reflections about an axis, roations, and translations.
